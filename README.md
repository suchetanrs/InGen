To run line follower, run the following commands
1. ```roslaunch line_follower_pkg yellow_line_world.launch```
2. In my case, my workspace name is ```Ingen_ws```, replace it with your workspace when you run this command, ```~/Ingen_ws/src/line_follower_pkg/src/```
3. chmod +x ```follower_script.py```
2. ```rosrun line_follower_pkg follower_script.py```
